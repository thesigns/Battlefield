        <h1>Battlefield</h1>
        <h2>of Cellular Automata</h2>
        <p>
          This application allows you to observe a battle of two cellular
          automata (the default rules for both of them is
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"
            >Conway's Game of Life</a
          >, but you can choose any variant). Each cell, dead or alive, belongs
          to a gold or a black automaton. Every turn each alive cell counts
          neigbouring allies and enemies. If there is more enemies than allies
          plus one, the cell joins enemy automaton. Also when the cell is born
          it switches sides if there is more enemies than allies around it.
          Besides this the cells are born and survive according to the battle
          settings.

          Make the rules, make them fight and observe how the gold and black
          madness breaks out :)
