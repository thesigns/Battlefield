## Observe a battle of two cellular automata

This application allows you to observe a battle of two cellular automata (the default rules for both of them is Conway's Game of Life, but you can choose any variant). Each cell, dead or alive, belongs to gold or black automaton. Every turn each alive cell counts neigbouring allies and enemies. If there is more enemies than allies plus one, the cell joins enemy automaton. Also when the cell is born it switches sides if there is more enemies than allies around it. The rest is standard rules.
